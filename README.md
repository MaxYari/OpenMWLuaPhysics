## Lua Physics for OpenMW

A deranged mod that implements a somewhat simple and naive physics engine in pure lua and exposes a rich interface for developers.

Think Half-Life 1 level of physics, maybe a bit better.

Apart from being mostly developer-centered api this mod also enables physics all of the items in the game (things you can put in you inventory). You can drag them around, throw them and break bottles. But be warned - messing around with someone's property too much - will not be tolerated (if noticed, which depends on your sneak skill, proximity and sheer luck)
